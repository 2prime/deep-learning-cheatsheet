\section{Modelling}

Hardware architecture is modelled as a set of processors $P_1, \ldots, P_m$, a set of buses, and the corresponding interconnection topology.
The application is modelled as a set of tasks $\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_n$.
Each task $\tau_i$ is characterized by its period $\pi_i$, its deadline $\delta_i$, its priority, its mapping $m(\tau_i)$, i.e.\ the processor on which every job of task $\tau_i$ executes, and its execution time probability density function (ETPDF) $\epsilon_i$.
The execution times of any two jobs (of the same or of different tasks) are assumend statistically independent.
There may exist data dependencies among the tasks.
